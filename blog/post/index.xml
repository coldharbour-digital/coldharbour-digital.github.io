      <description>Bioinformatics users are a demanding bunch. They need to be able to run a large variety of applications on powerful servers. These servers may be administered by a small team of sysadmins, who quickly become a bottleneck in packaging and installing applications for the local users. Using application packaging such as RPM can make the task manageable, but there is still a per-application overhead on the sysadmin, and with a typical site using perhaps in excess of 300 applications, this becomes unmanageable.</description>
