      <description>A BioInformatics pipeline may require invocation of some low-level programs like samtools hundreds or thousands of times. If these processes are run as BioContainers, using rkt for example, this means creation of very many rkt pods, adding up to a significant overhead both in space and time. Can we do better?
In fact we can. For the purpose of running a containerized application in this context, all that matters is which container image it is, and which user it runs as.</description>

      <description>Commonly, BioInformatics pipelines are built by piping output between applications. If each application is itself a BioContainer, and we are running them using rkt, this means we need to be able to pipe output between rkt pods. How can we do this?
Rkt supports running multiple applications within a pod, so has no direct concept of pod standard input and standard output. By default, application output goes to the systemd journal within the pod, which appears on the standard output of the pod itself.</description>

      <title>Using BioContainers on a multi-user server</title>

      <description>Bioinformatics users are a demanding bunch. They need to be able to run a large variety of applications on powerful servers. These servers may be administered by a small team of sysadmins, who quickly become a bottleneck in packaging and installing applications for the local users. Using application packaging such as RPM can make the task manageable, but there is still a per-application overhead on the sysadmin, and with a typical site using perhaps in excess of 300 applications, this becomes unmanageable.</description>
