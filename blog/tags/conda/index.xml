      <description>Conda is a platform-neutral packaging system. The BioConda channel is of particular interest for bioinformatics users, as it provides access to an enormous library of ready-to-use bioinformatics applications, which can be otherwise notoriously difficult to install.
One of the problems solved by Conda, and BioConda, is the dependency hell which results from trying to install several applications, which have requirements for incompatible versions of their dependencies, for example different versions of samtools.</description>
