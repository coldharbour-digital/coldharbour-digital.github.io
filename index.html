  <h1>Linux</h1>
  <p>Coldharbour Digital have gained substantial experience working with
Linux and UNIX-like operating systems over a period of 28 years or
more.</p>

<p>Our work with Linux dates from 1999, and includes kernel configuration
and assembly of a complete Linux distribution from scratch.  We have
considerable experience in Linux system administration, including
application packaging, having packaged several hundred bioinformatics
applications for Red Hat Enterprise Linux.</p>

<p>Our work with UNIX dates from 1988, when we developed a system level
service for checkpointing of user processes on DEC Ultrix, just one of
many examples of UNIX system programming.</p>

  <h1>DevOps</h1>
  <p>Coldharbour Digital has been engaged in DevOps since before the
term was invented, mostly in Linux environments.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-devops">What is DevOps?</h2>

<p>DevOps is what happens if you ask a software developer to perform
system administration and infrastructure management.  Rather than
working on the level of configuring individual servers, the focus is
on development of the site configuration manifest, which is applied in
a uniform and automated way to all servers.</p>

<h2 id="benefits">Benefits</h2>

<p>With DevOps, everything is:</p>

<ul>
<li>uniform</li>
<li>automated</li>
<li>scalable</li>
<li>inherently documented</li>
</ul>

<p>Uniformity of server configuration is a key way to reduce
infrastructure management costs, by eliminating ad hoc differences
between servers.  Once a system is working, it stays working.</p>

<p>Better, stronger, faster, for significantly less then 6 million dollars.</p>

<h2 id="how">How?</h2>

<p>Server configuration management is performed using tools such as Puppet,
Chef, Salt, Ansible, or CFEngine.  At Coldharbour Digital, our
favourite is Puppet, but any of these are a huge improvement over a
manual approach.</p>

<p>Configuration is contained in a central side-wide manifest, kept under
configuration control.  For configuration control, we recommend a
modern revision control system such as Git or Mercurial.</p>

<p>Server deployment is a critical aspect of infrastructure management.
This can be fully automated through PXE boot over the network, using
kickstart files.  Cobbler is a key tool for managing kickstart
installation and initial configuration from manifests that we have
found to be extremely beneficial.</p>

              <article id="security">
  <h1>Security</h1>
  <p>Coldharbour Digital have experience with computer and network security frameworks and implementation.</p>

<h2 id="best-practice">Best Practice</h2>

<p>Our work in this area is informed by leading experts: Ross Anderson
("Security Engineering"), Steve Bellovin ("Thinking Security"), and
Adam Shostack ("Threat Modeling").</p>

<p>We have experience with the Center for Internet Security
recommendations for Red Hat Enterprise Linux, both Level 1 and Level
2, including firewall configuration, advanced SELinux customisation,
and intrusion detection.</p>

              <article id="development">
  <h1>Development</h1>
  <p>Coldharbour Digital have vast experience in software development, in a
variety of languages, environments, and application domains.</p>

<p>We are well versed in C, C++, Java, JavaScript, Go, Ada, Python, Perl,
Haskell, Smalltalk, Git, Mercurial, ClearCase, X/Motif, UML, Rational
Rose, Teamwork, Linux and various Unix, VxWorks and both object
oriented and functional programming techniques.</p>

<p>We have used many different development methodologies, from classical
waterfall, through iterative (Rational Unified Process), and agile.
Latterly, so-called agile methodologies seem to us to have become very
much less agile than was originally envisaged.  Our preference these
days is for Kanban, as described by David J Anderson in his book of
the same name.</p>

              <article id="about">
  <h1>About</h1>
  <p>Coldharbour Digital was founded in 2015 by Simon Guest.</p>

<p>Simon graduated from the University of Cambridge with an M.A. in
Mathematics and a Diploma in Computer Science.  He started his career
in 1989 in the United Kingdom, where he worked as a programmer for
Praxis High Integrity Systems.  His rigorous mathematical background
and early work on high integrity systems for air traffic control were
an integral part of the development of his high discipline approach to
industrial-strength software development and system administration.</p>

<p>Simon's later roles included software development team leading in
Siemens UK Research Centre at Roke Manor during the 1990s and early
2000s, working in mobile telecommunications and computer networks.</p>

<p>Since 2008, Simon has been living and working in New Zealand, where
his roles have included working as a senior consultant within
AgResearch, with responsibility both for the High Performance Compute
environment, and for the company I.T. security framework.</p>
